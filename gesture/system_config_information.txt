On your Raspberry Pi, run the following commands in order to get IMUpi.py to run on boot:

$ cd /etc/systemd/system 
$ sudo touch 180D.service 
$ sudo nano 180D.service

Within 180D.service, copy/paste the following (while modifying the necessary directories):

###

[Unit]
Description=Service for UCLA's ECE 180D class
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=pi #modify user as needed
ExecStart=python3 /home/pi/Desktop/180da/Team1/IMUpi.py #modify directory as needed
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/Desktop/180da/Team1/ #modify directory as needed

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

###

Save and exit.
Then run the following commands:

$ systemctl enable 180D.service
$ systemctl start 180D.service

Your Raspi will now boot IMUpi.py on boot.
