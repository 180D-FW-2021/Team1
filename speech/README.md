This part of the project was Steven's responsibility.

Contains `speech_processing.py`, which implements the speech processing module of this project. Transcribes all audio to text, and detects keywords "power", "channel", and "volume".

Code adapted from Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API example code:
https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/samples?hl=en_US

Also required to run this code is a Google Cloud private key. It has been removed from this public repository, but is available upon request.
