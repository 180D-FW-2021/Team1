## Credits

This part of the project was everyone's responsibility.

Sierra began the GUI by creating some skeleton code for it, which included the general aesthetic, buttons, and ideas of what to include (such as tutorial videos). 
Steven implemented the tutorial play video buttons, and the controller launch/stop buttons.

To play a tutorial video, click a button under the "Tutorial Videos" tab. To start the controller, press "Start Controller". To stop, press "Stop Controller".

Before running the code, please execute the following commands:
```
pip install python-tk
pip install imageio
pip install playsound
brew install portaudio
```
