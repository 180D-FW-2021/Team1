## Credits

This part of the project was everyone's responsibility.

Sierra began the GUI by creating some skeleton code for it, which included the general aesthetic, buttons, and ideas of what to include (such as tutorial videos). 
Steven implemented the tutorial play video buttons, and the controller launch/stop buttons. Isaac implemented more buttons, some layout changes, and the tutorial pictures for his section.

To play a tutorial video, click a button under the "Tutorial Videos" tab. To open a tutorial picture, simply click on the button corresponding to the command you wish to enact. 

To start the controller, press "Start Controller". To stop, press "Stop Controller". There are also options to start only a section of the controller in case that is your preference.

Before running the code, please execute the following commands:
```
pip install python-tk
pip install imageio
pip install playsound
brew install portaudio
```
